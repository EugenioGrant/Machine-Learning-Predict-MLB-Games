# Machine-Learning-Predict-MLB-Games

This project's goal is to employ machine learning to predict the outcomes of individual MLB games. Using web scraping, 20 years of game-by-game data was harvested from baseball-reference.com. The final random forest model achieved a standalone classification accuracy of 59.6%, amongst higher levels found in scientific literature and higher than the Vegas odds by 0.2% over the same period. When adding the Vegas moneyline as an extra input variable, the combined model achieved an accuracy of 61.1%, outperforming the Vegas odds by 0.8%.
